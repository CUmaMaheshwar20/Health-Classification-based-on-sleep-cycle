# Health-Classification-based-on-sleep-cycle

# Project Overview
This project explores the relationship between sleep duration, stress levels, physical activity, and occupation using a comprehensive dataset. The goal was to uncover key insights that could inform decision-making in healthcare, wellness programs, and policy-making. Through interactive Tableau visualizations, this analysis provides actionable insights into how lifestyle factors and demographic variables affect sleep quality and stress levels.

# Key Questions Addressed
1) How does sleep duration correlate with stress levels?

2) What is the impact of physical activity on sleep quality?

3) How do occupation and age affect sleep duration and quality?

4) What interrelationships exist between various sleep metrics (e.g., heart rate, stress, physical activity)?

# Project Highlights
Data Visualization: Developed interactive Tableau dashboards to visualize complex relationships between multiple factors, making it easy to uncover trends and actionable insights.

Insight 1: Negative correlation between sleep duration and stress levels — shorter sleep durations (6-7 hours) lead to higher stress levels.

Insight 2: Physical activity has a significant positive impact on sleep quality, with higher activity levels corresponding to better sleep quality reports.

Insight 3: Occupation and age influence sleep duration, with healthcare workers and managers reporting the least sleep, while younger professionals generally get more rest.

Insight 4: Interconnected sleep metrics — occupations with less sleep tend to report higher stress, and gender/age factors play a role in this dynamic.

# Target Audience
Healthcare Professionals: To understand the relationship between sleep, stress, and physical activity for better patient care.

Policymakers & Wellness Designers: To guide population-level interventions aimed at improving sleep and health outcomes.

General Public & Health-Conscious Individuals: To gain insights into how daily habits like occupation and activity levels influence overall health and sleep quality.
